## Project introduction

Objectives:
To explore the explanatory power of property-related crime models during the COVID-19 pandemic using (1) dynamic human activity variables (2) static variables of social disorganisation and crime generator in urban neighbourhoods and (3) combinations of both sets of variables.  

Methods:
We first generated the human activity variables measured by footfalls with different daily and weekly time intervals detected from geo-tagged big data represented by mobile phone GPS trajectory data.
Then, we trained LASSO regression models to evaluate the correlations between property crime patterns and dynamic and static explanatory variables.
Three types of models (i.e., static, dynamic and static\&dynamic) differentiated in input explanatory variable groups were developed for each type of property crime.

Results:
By employing the proposed approach to property crime with seven categories in neighbourhood areas of London, UK from 2020 to 2021, our findings demonstrate that each optimised property crime model considering the combination of static and dynamic explanatory variables reaches the best model performance.
Further, human activity dynamics impose a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. 
In terms of crime type, theft from the person obtains particularly high correlations with dynamic human activity compared to other property crimes.
Further analysis reveals important nuances in the relationships between property crimes and human activity across different times and contexts. 

Conclusions: 
The results directly verify the explanation that property crime patterns are highly related to dynamic human activity in neighbourhoods, providing further support for crime risk prediction that considers the impact of dynamic human activity variables and their varying influences in distinct situations.
