## Project introduction

This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between different groups of explanatory variables (i.e., dynamic human activity variables, static variables of social disorganisation and crime generators, and combinations of both sets of variables) and property crime patterns across neighbourhood areas of London during the pandemic (from 2020 to 2021). Using the dynamic human activity variables sensed from mobile phone GPS big data sets, three types of ‘Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator’ (LASSO) regression models (i.e., static, dynamic, and static and dynamic) differentiated into explanatory variable groups were developed for seven types of property crime. Then, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to reveal the spatial associations between distinct explanatory variables and the specific type of crime. The findings demonstrated that human activity dynamics impose a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. In terms of crime type, theft obtained particularly high relationships with dynamic human activity compared to other property crimes. Further analysis revealed important nuances in the spatial associations between property crimes and human activity across different contexts during the pandemic. The result provides support for crime risk prediction that considers the impact of dynamic human activity variables and their varying influences in distinct situations.
